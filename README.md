# Personal Prism Pioneer Program

This is my tiny contribution to the [Prism Pioneer Program](https://ppp.atalaprism.io/app), a set of flash cards.

## What are flash cards?

[Flash cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard) are an efficient learning technique. The method behind it is called [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition).


## How can I learn?

- The flash cards are written in Markdown
- But can be easily converted to [Anik flash cards](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)
- Anki is the most popular tool for learning with flash cards
- It has clients for desktop, mobile, web.
  So nothing stops you from learning anywhere
